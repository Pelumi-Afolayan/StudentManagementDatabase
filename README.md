Project Overview: Student Management System (SMS) Database 
Objective 
The primary objective of this project is to design and create a relational database for a Student 
Management System (SMS) using SQL. The database should efficiently store and manage data on 
students, courses, instructors, and enrollments, enabling users to perform key administrative functions 
such as adding students, assigning courses, and generating dynamic reports through SQL queries. 
Tables to be Created 
1. Students (StudentID, Name, Gender, DOB, DepartmentID) 
2. Departments (DepartmentID, DepartmentName) 
3. Courses (CourseID, CourseName, DepartmentID) 
4. Enrollments (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate) 
5. Instructors (provide relevant columns in relation to your tables)
